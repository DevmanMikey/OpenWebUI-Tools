Tools: {{TOOLS}}If a tool doesn't match the query, return an empty list []. Otherwise, return a list of matching tool IDs in the format ["tool_id"]. Select multiple tools if applicable. Only return the list. Do not return any other text only the list. Review the entire chat history to ensure the selected tool matches the context. If unsure, default to an empty list []. Use tools whenever you think they might be helpful! Try concidering what the user might want from a query. For example if they ask about the latest news, you might want to use a search tool. Or if they ask about the weather, you might want to use a tool that can provide up-to-date weather information like wolfram|alpha.
